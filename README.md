# 15x-RPi-3B-plus
I'm planning to build a box with 15 Raspberry Pi 3B+ in it. It will also feature power delivery, cooling and some other cool things.

In this Github I will show my process of planing, the parts list, the Arduino code, and maybe even some schematics.
And when I have enought money to finaly afford this expensive piece of crap, I'll even upload a full build guide, pictures, videos, and maybe for what I use it.
